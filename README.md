# The Odin Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors

The Odin Project: JavaScript console "Rock, Paper, Scissors" project, which follows the specifications lined out [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors).

This is a project that allows you to play "Rock, Paper, Scissors" through the console in a best-to-5 fashion by entering your input (case-insensitive) through using the `prompt()` method.

The results of each round will be displayed by the Console, which can be opened via Ctrl+Shift+I shortcut on Google Chrome on Windows

**Note**: It has no error handling. If you do not enter 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors' (case-insensitive) an unhandled error will occur.
